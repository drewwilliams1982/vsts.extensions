## Fast Artifacts

A series of tasks for improving artifact upload speed

Uploading lots of artifacts to VSTS is very slow.  It is much quicker to compress the artifacts and then upload.  This extension allows you to compress the artifacts with zero compression (for speed).  This improves the upload speed enormously.  You can then use the Expand task to download them.
