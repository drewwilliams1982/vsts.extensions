# Artifact Variables

This is a task for TFS to provide basic support for [Artifact Variables](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/release/author-release-definition/understanding-artifacts#artifact-variables)

It makes the following variables available for each of the linked artifacts:

- Definition Id: ReleaseArtifacts.{ArtifactName}.DefinitionId
- Definition Name: ReleaseArtifacts.{ArtifactName}.DefinitionName
- Build Number: ReleaseArtifacts.{ArtifactName}.BuildNumber
- Build Id: ReleaseArtifacts.{ArtifactName}.BuildId
